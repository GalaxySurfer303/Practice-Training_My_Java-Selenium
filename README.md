# ============== Java Selenium Automation Journey ==============

Welcome to my first serious project in **Java** with **Selenium**! ðŸš€  

This repository will evolve into a comprehensive collection of **raw test scripts** and a **custom automation framework**, showcasing my progression and expertise in test automation.

## ============== Key Highlights ==============

- **Custom Framework**: Development of a scalable and reusable automation framework, aligned with industry best practices.
- **Personal Milestone**: This project represents my focus on Java as the core platform for future test automation work.

## ============== My Journey ==============

While I started with Python for automation and successfully built my foundation with Selenium and PyTest, **Java** is my ultimate target platform. Through this repository, I aim to master Java-based automation to enhance my professional capabilities and take on advanced challenges.
