Java Selenium Automation Journey 

===========
My Manifest
===========

I am continually learning and striving to transition from a manual tester to an automation engineer. With over 14 years of experience in manual testing, Iâ€™ve faced increasing challenges in finding work in Poland since 2023, as manual testers are often undervalued. Despite searching for over a year, I remain determined to upskill and build a career in automation testing. This repository is a significant milestone in my journey, showcasing my progress and dedication to mastering automation frameworks.



Welcome to my first serious project in **Java** with **Selenium**! ðŸš€  

This repository will evolve into a comprehensive collection of **raw test scripts** and a **custom automation framework**, showcasing my progression and expertise in test automation.

==============
Key Highlights
==============

- **Raw Test Scripts**: Initial examples to solidify the basics of Selenium and Java integration.
- **Custom Framework**: Development of a scalable and reusable automation framework, aligned with industry best practices.
- **Personal Milestone**: This project represents my focus on Java as the core platform for future test automation work.

==========
My Journey 
==========

While I started with Python for automation and successfully built my foundation with Selenium and PyTest, **Java** is my ultimate target platform. Through this repository, I aim to master Java-based automation to enhance my professional capabilities and take on advanced challenges.

Stay tuned for updates as this repository grows and transforms! ðŸ˜Š

Current Status (as of December 1, 2024) - Commit 1
===================================================

**Update Summary:**  
- Uploaded initial files from local storage.  
- Created **two test scripts**:  
  1. **Local ChromeDriver Script**: Utilizes a physical ChromeDriver executable stored locally on the disk.  
  2. **Remote ChromeDriver Script**: Configured to interact with a remote ChromeDriver setup for executing tests.  

**Current Scope:**  
The tests are currently focused on automating interactions with the Google homepage. The primary goal was to set up the **Java development environment**, including:  
- Configuring **Maven** for project dependency management.  
- Creating and fine-tuning the **pom.xml** file for seamless integration.

This is the foundation for a more advanced framework to be built in the coming iterations. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
